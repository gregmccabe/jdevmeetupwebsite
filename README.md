#The JDev Meetup

This is a meetup for developers who are looking to learn something new and take on side projects.

We meet once a week for two hours to learn collaboratively a technology or technology stack.

We learn by doing, so we will be building web applications and other pieces of software. 

We are looking for mentors in the San Antonio area, too, so if you know a lot of coding, please email us at [jdevmeetup@gmail.com](mailto:jdevmeetup@gmail.com).

This repository is for the JDev Meetup Website. We are looking forward to building it as a means for people to stay up to date on what is going on with the meetup and where they can go to get more information.

In the future, we would like it to be a one-stop-shop for all of the developers' needs in the meetup with blogs, links, and articles on best practices when it comes to development.
